    """
    A helper class to ease composing quantum circuits.

    This class currently limits a possible wiring to attaching a quantum
    circuit (``qc``) to an existing one (``qc0``).  For this to be able to
    occur, ``qc`` must be a register oriented quantum circuit in the
    following sense.

    1. All qubits must be accountable through _its_ quantum registers, and
       vice versa.
    2. The wiring instruction (the ``wiring`` argument) should either exhaust
       a quantum register or leave it untouched.  That is, it is not allowed
       to wire only some qubits in a register.
    3. All unwired registers (which include any classical registers in ``qc``)
       will be added to ``qc0``.

    The per-instruction actions occur through
    :meth:`~WiringInstruction.prepare` and :meth:`~WiringInstruction.apply`.

    The static method :meth:`~WiringInstruction.wire` is a convenience method
    to wire multiple quantum circuits to an initial quantum circuit.

            prepared preceding quantum circuit (``qc0``) to the qubits of
            ``qc``.

            Indices can be negative (reverse index).

            Note that as a quantum circuit is prepared for wiring, its qubit
            registers will become more numerous.  Negative indexes are
            interpreted when preparing (:meth:`~WiringInstruction.prepare`)
